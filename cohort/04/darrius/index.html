    <h1> Welcome to the art place</h1>
<h2> all about me </h2>
<p> Hi my name is Darrius, and I started art when I was 7 years old. Born in Boston, Massachusetts. I am a shy person, and I break out of my shell by sharing my art. I work with a variety of art media. I mainly work with paint, fiber arts, and drawings of black people. The main reason why I draw back people is because that is what I see in my day-to-day life. My art style is more based on realism than meets the eye. My art came from a place of depression and sadness. More of that feeling came around 2019 when COVID hit, and that is when I found out that I want to do art as a career. My art education started by being self-taught, and then I went to YouTube University (not a real place) </p>
