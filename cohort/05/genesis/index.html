<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>My name is Genesis, Im from Dominican Republic. I was born in La Capital, Alma Rosa. I love my country and its culture. I love the music, dances, and the games I used to play when i was little. Something I really miss is when I would be in DR en el barrio(in the hood) and the light would go off everyone would scream "se fur la luzzz", we would have to go to thr colmado(the coner store) and buy candles. I prefer being in the DR then here to me DR is home because it's where me and my family were born and shared the most fun moments.
