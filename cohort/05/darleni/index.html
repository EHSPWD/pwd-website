<h4>Climate</h4>
<p>The Dominican Republic has a tropical climate with hot, consistent temperatures year-round, ranging from \(18^{\circ }C\) to \(35^{\circ }C\) (\(64^{\circ }F\) to \(95^{\circ }F\)) depending on the region and season. It has two main seasons: a dry season from January to May, and a wet season from June to December, which also includes the risk of hurricanes. The northern mountains receive significantly more rainfall than the drier western and southwestern valleys.</p>
<h4>Dominjcan history</h4>
<p>The history of the Dominican Republic begins with the indigenous Taino people, who inhabited the island they called Hispaniola. Christopher Columbus arrived in 1492, claiming the island for Spain and establishing the first permanent European settlement in the Americas at Santo Domingo, which was followed by the decimation of the Taino population through disease and enslavement. The island was later divided, with Spain controlling the eastern part (present-day Dominican Republic) and France controlling the west (Haiti). The Dominican Republic declared independence from Spain in 1844, but its history since then includes periods of Spanish rule, US occupation, and the long, brutal dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo, with a modern era of democratic rule and economic growth beginning in the late 20th century</p>
<h4>Independence and instability (1844–1924)</h4>
<ul>
    <li>First independence: In 1844, the Dominican Republic declared independence from Haiti, with Juan Pablo Duarte, Francisco del Rosario Sánchez, and Ramón Matías Mella considered the founding fathers. </li>
    <li>Spanish annexation: The following decades were marked by political instability. In 1861, President Pedro Santana returned the country to Spanish rule to combat a weak economy, but a revolt led to Spain's withdrawal in 1865 and the proclamation of the Second Dominican Republic</li>
    <li>US occupation: Due to mounting debt, the U.S. took control of the Dominican Republic's customs in 1905 and occupied the country with military forces from 1916 to 1924. The U.S. occupation left behind a modern military that paved the way for Trujillo's rise to power.
