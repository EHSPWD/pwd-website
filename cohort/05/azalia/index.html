<li>Once yall walk in yall can say hi to speedy but please be in your seat before she starts or before bell.</li>
<li>When you sit down get your materials out so your ready because believe everything she says helps you to not only learn but to help build your website.</li>
<li>Before the you go into lab make sure your do-now is in the bin or any other paper.</li>
<li>One more thing for being in the classroom or lab is you dont really have to ask because on the board she will have writing in blue if your in the lab and black if its a lecture in classroom.</li>
