    <h2>How is Ice-Cream made?</h2>
    <p>Ice-cream is made by blending milk, cream, sugar, and flavorings, then pasteurizing, homogenizing, and rapidly chilling the mixture before churning it to incorporate air and form small ice crystals, and finally freezing it solid in a blast freezer for a smooth, creamy texture</p>
    <h2>What's My Favorite Ice-cream flavor?</h2>
    <p>Rocky Road is likely my favorite because of the delightful mix of textures (creamy, chewy, crunchy) and flavors (rich chocolate, sweet marshmallow, nutty almond) that create a sensory adventure in every bite, a contrast that many find irresistibly satisfying and nostalgic, symbolizing life's "rocky" but sweet journey. </p>
