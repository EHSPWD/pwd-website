  <h1>Top 10 lowest ranked high in Massachusetts</h1>
  <h3> By: Mae</h3>
<h2> Reasons Why Schools Might How Lower Ranking</h2>
<p>A school's low ranking is typically influenced by factors both within the school's control (such as teacher turnover and curriculum variety) and external socioeconomic factors (such as student poverty levels and parental involvement). External factors often have a greater impact on rankings than what happens inside the school, as many ranking systems rely heavily on metrics highly correlated with student demographics. </p>
<h2> Thing that could bring up the ranked</h3>
<p>School rankings are boosted by factors like high graduation rates, strong student outcomes (earnings, low debt), academic reputation, faculty resources, and student selectivity, with different organizations weighting these metrics (e.g., U.S. News, Niche), but also considering social mobility, financial strength, and even Nobel laureates, while omitting test scores to align with admissions trends. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Graduation & Retention Rates: Higher percentages of students graduating and returning for sophomore year.</li>
  <li>Graduate Earnings: Graduates earning more than typical high school grads.</li>
  <li>Social Mobility: Strong performance and graduation rates for Pell Grant recipients.</li>
  <li>Test Scores: Median SAT/ACT scores of incoming classes (though some rankings are de-emphasizing this).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Factors Beyond a School's Control</h2>
<p>Socioeconomic Status (SES): A student's family income and neighborhood account for a significant portion of variance in test scores. Schools in areas with high rates of poverty are more likely to have lower rankings regardless of teaching quality.
Family and Home Environment: Parental involvement, a stable home life, and family attitudes toward education heavily influence student performance.
Student Demographics: Factors like student mobility (frequent moving between schools), a high percentage of students learning English as a second language, and a lack of access to rigorous advanced courses can affect overall school performance metrics.
Funding Disparities: While some state funding models exist, differences in local tax bases often lead to disparities in per-pupil spending, with lower-income areas having fewer resources. </p>
