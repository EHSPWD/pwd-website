<h1>softball</h1>
<p1>softball is a bat-and-ball sport similar to baseball but played with a larger ball, a smaller field, and underhand pitches. Created by George Hancock in 1887 in Chicago, it is played by teams aiming to score runs by hitting the ball and running around bases. Softball is played competitively at various levels, including professional, college, and club levels, and has even been an Olympic sport.
