<h1>🍟</h1>
<p> in my opinion, one of the best foods,aka french fries. Another foods that i think is one of the best is bread.. Chicken and shrimp alfredo is good also.alright so we got mcdonalds, burger king ehh its up there, popeyes. now popeyes is really good whwen your really craving it.We got canes, wendys,and some chinese/japanese foods. It be so good when you haven't had it in a long time and once you finally get it and eat it you'll fall inlove.</p>
